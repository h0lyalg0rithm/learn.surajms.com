When searching for some online courses to learn spanish, I came across FutureLearn.

It is a four week course and I plan to finish it in 4 days.

Lets get started!

The course starts out with some basic phrases that one would use.

| Spanish  | English |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Hola  | Hello  |
| Buenos Días  | Good morning |
| ¿Qué tal?  | How are you ? |
| Muy bien, gracias.  | Very well, Thanks |
| ¿Y tú?  | And you? |

The course then tries to teach you some spanish etiquettes.


### Hand shakes or kisses? ###

In Spanish and Latin American countries it is customary to greet female friends and family members by kissing them on one or both cheeks

It then teaches you how to spell the vowels.

Using special characters on the keyboard
- for accented vowels, press Option and e, then the vowel key
- for ñ, press Option and n, then n
- for ü, press Option and u, then u
- for ¿, press Option and Shift and ?
- for ¡, press Option and 1.

| Spanish | English |
| ------- | -------|
| Buenos días | Good Morning |
| Buenas tardes | Good Afternoon |
| Buenas noches | Good Night |
| Adiós | Good Bye |
| Hasta leugo | See you later |
| Hasta mañana | See you tomorrow morning |
| Chao | Bye |
| (yo) soy |	I am |
| (tú) eres| 	you are |
| (usted) es	| you are |
| (él, ella) |es	he, she is |

We then learn to say and ask for a persons name.

In Spanish you start a question with an inverted question mark and end it with a regular one.

| Spanish | English |
| ------- | ------- |
| me llamo | My name |
| te llamas | Your name |
| Se llamas | Her name |
| ¿ Como te llamas ? | What is your name |



### Introductions ###

| Spanish | English |
| ------- | ------- |
| Informal situation | |
| Le presento a Carlos Frutos. |	Let me introduce Carlos Frutos. |
| Le presento a la señora Serra. |	Let me introduce Mrs Serra. |
| Informal situation | |
| Este es Carlos. | This is Carlos. |
| Esta es Consuelo. | This is Consuelo. |
| Encantado / Encantada | Pleased to meet you |

The course gives you a good mix of vocabulary and practice question to reinforce what you have learning.
