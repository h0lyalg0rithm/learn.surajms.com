I created this blog so I can catalog what I have am learning.

It seems like whenever I learn something I tend to lose track of my progress and jump to the next shiny thing.With the help of this blog acting as a progress checkpoint,I can switch between different courses/learning material or even projects without having to mentally juggle the state.

Moreover its been a while since I started doing some serious computer science, as my day job entails playing with UIs for websites and mobile application.

For a while I have been using wordpress to manage my blog but for this project I will using jekyll. It keeps my mind at ease without worrying about the new zero day that is in the wild or the database bottlenecking etc.

Getting back to the meat of the topic.What is learning?
Learning for me is understanding something and making it part of you.You would never hear anyone asking you "When did you learn your mother tongue".Instead it is assumed that it is part of you even though you spent time learning it.

I have already started some a couple of online courses:
- [Spanish 101](spanish_1) - A four week spanish 101 learning program from futurelearn.
- [MIT 6.006](mit_6.006) - MIT free intro to algorithms course.
- [CMSC 22300](elm_course) - Purely Functional Data Structures in Elm (Though it might use the old elm syntax the concepts in the course still apply)
